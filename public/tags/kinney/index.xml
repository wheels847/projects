      <description>Several years ago, in 2005, when I was first getting into genealogy I was excite to learn that DNA was being used to help family historians determine their background and get in contact with people that shared common Ancestors. I immediately found FamilyTreeDNA and requested a 37-marker test. I received the results and joined the “Wheeler” project.
In 2005, using DNA for genealogy was extremely new and unless you had some experience with the technology or you had someone to interpret the results for you, the value of DNA may have been limited. I was able to make contact with several individuals that I matched in the Wheeler Surname Project but it didn’t live up to my expectations. In 2008, I upgraded from 37 to 63 markers. I experienced similar results to that of my original results in that I had received results but how to use them and get in touch with others was limited. I reached out to a number of people that I had reported matches but many of them maintained paper records or family trees in GEDCOM format offline. In most cases I was unable to determine the shared ancestor.

      <description>I’ve got a little catching up to do on entries so you will see a lot of activity this week. I’ll do my best to keep a schedule in the future.
During week 3 of the 52 Ancestors challenge I posted information about Andrew Kinney (b. Abt 1823, d. 22 May 1900). Andrew’s wife is Margaret (nee McTavish) Kinney.
Margaret McTavish was born about 1825 in Scotland. Different records have Margaret born in different locations being either Ireland or Scotland. Most of the records that I have found indicate Scotland as the more likely location so until I have confirmation that it is Scotland or proof to the contrary, I am using Scotland as her place of birth.

      <description>A recent post shared some experiences which I’ve had with Ancestry.com DNA and the fact that I’ve recently reconnected with people (some now confirmed cousins) whom we suspected we shared a common ancestor. It was suspected that my 2nd great grandfather Andrew Kinney along with several other gentlemen found in Fond du Lac in the 1860 census were brothers. A recent DNA match notification has provided confirmation that one of those gentlemen, Patrick Kinney, is a brother or relative of Andrew Kinney. While Patrick isn’t one of my ancestors, I wanted to share what information I did have about Patrick to help our research.

      <description>I am extremely fortunate that my family has been able to preserve some fantastic family photos. One such photo is that of Andrew Kinney (or photos). You may recall that we introduced Sylvester Beasecker (52 Ancestors, #2) who married Katharine Kinney (b. 11 Oct 1869, d. 23 Dec 1912) about 1896 in Pennsylvania. Katharine Kinney’s parents were Andrew Kinney and Margaret McTavish.
Andrew Kinney was born about 1823 in Ireland. We have only been able to identify the approximate birth date and location for Andrew Kinney based upon census records, voter registration and death records. Andrew passed away 22 May 1900 in Chicago, Cook, Illinois. We know from an article in The Commonwealth published in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin that Andrew’s birth year is about 1823 based upon the age cited in the article. The article states that Andrew’s remains arrived from Chicago after Andrew passed away in his home located at 424 Park Avenue in Chicago.
