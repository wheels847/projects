      <description>One of my first brick walls was that of my 2nd great-grandfather, Willard Wheeler.
Willard Wheeler was born 18 August 1820 in Westmoreland, Cheshire, New Hampshire. Willard had a twin brother, William. Willard and William were the sons of Barnard Wheeler (b. 06 Dec 1788; d. abt. Jul 1836) and Susanna Pierce (b. 25 Mar 1787; d. unknown). Willard lived with his parents on 12 siblings in Swanzey, New Hampshire.

      <description> As I have stated previously, I am fortunate enough to be surrounded by photos of my ancestors. One such ancestor that I was introduced to at a relatively young age due to photos in our home was my great grandmother, Carra Inez (nee Tuttle) Wheeler.
Carra Inez Tuttle was born 27 Jul 1856 in Cavendish, Vermont to Augustus Tuttle and Elsie Robinson. While Carra was born in Cavendish, Vermont we find that Carra and her family were in Holyoke, Massachusetts by 1863 where Carra’s father owned a store.
