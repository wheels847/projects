      <description>One of my first brick walls was that of my 2nd great-grandfather, Willard Wheeler.
Willard Wheeler was born 18 August 1820 in Westmoreland, Cheshire, New Hampshire. Willard had a twin brother, William. Willard and William were the sons of Barnard Wheeler (b. 06 Dec 1788; d. abt. Jul 1836) and Susanna Pierce (b. 25 Mar 1787; d. unknown). Willard lived with his parents on 12 siblings in Swanzey, New Hampshire.
