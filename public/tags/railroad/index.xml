      <description>A recent post shared some experiences which I’ve had with Ancestry.com DNA and the fact that I’ve recently reconnected with people (some now confirmed cousins) whom we suspected we shared a common ancestor. It was suspected that my 2nd great grandfather Andrew Kinney along with several other gentlemen found in Fond du Lac in the 1860 census were brothers. A recent DNA match notification has provided confirmation that one of those gentlemen, Patrick Kinney, is a brother or relative of Andrew Kinney. While Patrick isn’t one of my ancestors, I wanted to share what information I did have about Patrick to help our research.
