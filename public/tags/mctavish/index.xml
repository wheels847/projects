      <description>I’ve got a little catching up to do on entries so you will see a lot of activity this week. I’ll do my best to keep a schedule in the future.
During week 3 of the 52 Ancestors challenge I posted information about Andrew Kinney (b. Abt 1823, d. 22 May 1900). Andrew’s wife is Margaret (nee McTavish) Kinney.
Margaret McTavish was born about 1825 in Scotland. Different records have Margaret born in different locations being either Ireland or Scotland. Most of the records that I have found indicate Scotland as the more likely location so until I have confirmation that it is Scotland or proof to the contrary, I am using Scotland as her place of birth.

      <description>I am extremely fortunate that my family has been able to preserve some fantastic family photos. One such photo is that of Andrew Kinney (or photos). You may recall that we introduced Sylvester Beasecker (52 Ancestors, #2) who married Katharine Kinney (b. 11 Oct 1869, d. 23 Dec 1912) about 1896 in Pennsylvania. Katharine Kinney’s parents were Andrew Kinney and Margaret McTavish.
Andrew Kinney was born about 1823 in Ireland. We have only been able to identify the approximate birth date and location for Andrew Kinney based upon census records, voter registration and death records. Andrew passed away 22 May 1900 in Chicago, Cook, Illinois. We know from an article in The Commonwealth published in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin that Andrew’s birth year is about 1823 based upon the age cited in the article. The article states that Andrew’s remains arrived from Chicago after Andrew passed away in his home located at 424 Park Avenue in Chicago.
