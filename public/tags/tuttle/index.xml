      <description>As I have stated previously, I am fortunate enough to be surrounded by photos of my ancestors. One such ancestor that I was introduced to at a relatively young age due to photos in our home was my great grandmother, Carra Inez (nee Tuttle) Wheeler.
Carra Inez Tuttle was born 27 Jul 1856 in Cavendish, Vermont to Augustus Tuttle and Elsie Robinson. While Carra was born in Cavendish, Vermont we find that Carra and her family were in Holyoke, Massachusetts by 1863 where Carra’s father owned a store.
