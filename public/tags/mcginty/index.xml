      <description>My maternal grandfather is John Patrick McGinty (b. 24 May 1905, Chicago, IL; d. 01 Nov 1962, Chicago, IL) who was the eldest son of Michael McGinty and Nellie Carolan.
John attended and graduated from St. Charles Borromeo for middle school in 1913. John graduated high school from St. Patrick Academy in June 1921. Upon graduation from high school, John followed in his father’s footsteps working as a plumber. </description>

      <description>I am currently in a genealogy certificate class at Boston University. One of our first projects was to select a family and review the 1920 and 1930 census for that family. I have reviewed lots of census records over the years but I don’t know that I have looked at them in quite this way before.
Michael McGinty was born 22 Oct 1871 in Bellageheer, Mohill, Leitrim, Ireland. Michael was the son of Michael Ginty (b. abt. 1831 in Leitrim, Ireland) and Elizabeth McGarry.

While we are talking about the Beaseckers, lets talk about one of the more interesting men in my family tree based upon what I have found out about him. Sylvester B. Beasecker was born 06 Feb 1859 in Goshen, Elkhart, Indiana. Sylvester is the son of Samuel Beasecker and Martha Ann Bowman. Over the course of his life, Sylvester had four (4) wives, owned several businesses and lived in several different states to include Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Georgia.
