While we are talking about the Beaseckers, lets talk about one of the more interesting men in my family tree based upon what I have found out about him. Sylvester B. Beasecker was born 06 Feb 1859 in Goshen, Elkhart, Indiana. Sylvester is the son of Samuel Beasecker and Martha Ann Bowman. Over the course of his life, Sylvester had four (4) wives, owned several businesses and lived in several different states to include Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Georgia.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.wheelergenealogy.com/2014/01/12/sylvester-beasecker-52-ancestors-"/></item><item><title>Sylvester Beasecker (52 Ancestors: #2 Sylvester B.

Not long after getting started, and with family pictures, I became interested in the life and history of my great-grandfather Sylvester Beasecker (b. 06 Feb 1859; d. 01 May 1933).
Sylvester is the son of Samuel Beasecker (b. 13 Feb 1831 in Montgomery, Ohio; d. 06 Jun 1888 in Goshen, Elkhart, Indiana). According to the International Marriage Records, 1560 - 1900, Samuel married Martha Browen born in Pennsylvania in 1836. Numerous searches for Martha Browen in and out of Pennsylvania yielded very little in regards to the background of Martha. Eventually I came across the death record for Martha (as well as several other Beaseckers) in South Bend, Indiana and she was buried in Sugar Grove Cemetery in Goshen, Indiana. On a trip from Illinois to Michigan, I made a detour and stopped by Sugar Grove Cemetery.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.wheelergenealogy.com/2014/01/05/martha-beasecker-52-ancestors-"/></item></channel></rss>
