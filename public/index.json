SAR recognizes qualifying civil service during the Revolutionary period. That category includes work that kept local government, courts, and law enforcement functioning while the war was underway.\nThe document trail that made me sit up straight # I found Revolutionary-era documentation referring to a Solomon Wheeler performing official civil/law-enforcement activity in New Hampshire in 1777.\nOne item describes a warrant out of Exeter, New Hampshire, addressed to “the Sheriff of the County of Rockingham, his under Sheriff or Deputy,” related to the arrest of a man suspected of counterfeiting. The description notes an autograph note by Deputy Sheriff Solomon Wheeler, dated 23 April 1777, reporting what he did and how the prisoner was forwarded onward.\nA second reference points to civil judicial service: a warrant dated 13 April 1777 issued by Justice of the Peace Solomon Wheeler to bring a defendant to Exeter, New Hampshire.\nTaken together, these records point to a Solomon Wheeler serving in an official civil capacity during the Revolutionary era.\nThe honest gap: proving which Solomon Wheeler # Right now, these documents prove a Solomon Wheeler served as a deputy sheriff (and/or justice of the peace) in New Hampshire in 1777.\nWhat I still need to prove is that this Solomon is my Solomon: Solomon Wheeler (b. 1747 Shrewsbury, MA; married Zipporah Harrington; later in Westmoreland, NH).\nThat proof will likely come from:\nan appointment/commission record naming the deputy sheriff (and ideally his residence), court/county records that tie the deputy sheriff to known family members, land/tax/probate records placing Solomon in the right place at the right time, and (if needed) signature comparison across documents. Why I’m doing this now # The timing feels right. As we move toward the 250th anniversary of American Independence (1776–2026), it’s fitting to revisit the question and document it properly — the way a supplemental application deserves.\nIf this turns out the way I hope, it won’t just be “a Wheeler.” It’ll be a Wheeler who served in the unglamorous but essential machinery of law and government during the Revolution.\nNext steps (research plan) # Identify the exact office/commission record for Solomon Wheeler in Rockingham County (or the state/county authority that appointed him). Pull Rockingham County court materials that might name the deputy sheriff or justice of the peace more fully. Build a tight timeline for my Solomon (Shrewsbury MA → New Hampshire) using deeds, tax lists, probate, and town records.

But every so often, a detail jumps off the page and makes a person feel real.\nOne of those details in this line is simple: Augustus Tuttle owned a store.\nA census snapshot: farmer in 1850 # In 1850, Augustus Tuttle appears in Weathersfield, Windsor County, Vermont, recorded as a farmer. That fits what you’d expect for a 20-year-old in mid-century Vermont: land, labor, seasons, and the kind of work that rarely leaves a paper trail beyond the census.\n1857: a general store in Cavendish village # Later evidence points to a shift from farming toward commerce. A biographical sketch of Oscar S. Tuttle (Augustus’s brother) states that in 1857 the brothers opened a general store in Cavendish village under the firm name “A. \u0026amp; O. S. Tuttle.”\nA general store in 1850s Vermont wasn’t a specialty shop—it was the community’s supply chain. Even when we don’t yet have the original store ads or ledger books in hand, “general store” typically meant a wide range of practical goods: household staples, basic tools, cloth and notions, and whatever else people needed between trips to larger towns.\n1863: the business moves to Holyoke and focuses on dry goods # The same biographical account notes a second move: in the fall of 1863, the brothers relocated their business to Holyoke, Massachusetts and confined it to dry goods.\nThat phrase matters. In 19th-century terms, “dry goods” usually means textiles, clothing, and related wares—not groceries or hardware. In other words: the business appears to have shifted from “everything the town needs” (Cavendish) to a more specialized retail model (Holyoke).\nA later advertising description for O. S. Tuttle in Holyoke reinforces the kind of merchandise being sold there—items like cloaks, suits, ladies’ underclothing, and “small wares,” with a Holyoke address on High Street. That may represent the later continuation of the Holyoke operation (possibly after the partnership changed), but it helps us understand what “dry goods” meant in practice.\nThe open questions (and why they’re fun) # The core arc—farmer → Cavendish general store → Holyoke dry goods—is strong, but the best genealogy stories tighten when we add primary sources:\nWhat exactly did the Cavendish store sell (ads, ledgers, tax lists)? Where exactly was it located (map, deed, directory, lot description)? How long did the A. \u0026amp; O. S. Tuttle partnership last, and how did it evolve once in Holyoke? Those questions are answerable—and the trail is likely sitting in city directories, newspapers, and local records.\nSources (genealogy-friendly) # 1850 U.S. census, Weathersfield, Windsor County, Vermont, entry for Augustus Tuttle (occupation: farmer).

Thomas is noted as dying between 5 May and 23 August 1654 in Fairfield; Ann follows, recorded as dying between 21 August and 20 October 1659, also in Fairfield.\nThose date ranges read like the quiet language of early records: not always a neat death certificate, but enough to place a life in time.\nThe Concord branch # One of their children, Thomas Wheeler (Sergeant), links the Bedfordshire origins directly to a town that becomes a long-running Wheeler hub:\nThomas Wheeler (Sergeant)\nborn 8 December 1621, Cranfield, Bedfordshire, England\ndied 24 December 1704, Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts.\nConcord in the 1600s is a place of farms, militia lists, and town meetings—a community where surnames repeat across deeds, baptisms, and boundary disputes. The “Sergeant” detail is a tiny word with a lot behind it: responsibility, public role, and the expectation of showing up when the community needed order.\nThomas is identified with marriages to women from well-established Massachusetts families, including Sarah Merriam (died 1 February 1676, Concord) and Sarah Beers (born 5 December 1639, Lexington; died 24 January 1724, Concord). The precise order and details are worth verifying with primary sources, but the theme is clear: the Wheelers are now firmly woven into the fabric of Middlesex County life.\nA life measured in generations # From Concord, the tree carries the Wheeler surname forward into the next generation born on Massachusetts soil. One example recorded is:\nJohn Wheeler\nborn 18 February 1655, Concord, Massachusetts\ndied 1 December 1736, Concord, Massachusetts\nmarried Sarah Stearns (born 14 January 1662, Cambridge; died 19 December 1727, Concord).\nThat’s the rhythm genealogy loves: the same town name repeating through birth and death, with marriages connecting to other local families. Over time, those stable “same place” generations become the launching pad for later movement—westward, cityward, or into new counties as the country expands.\nA note on heraldry and the “Catherine wheels” # The crest we\u0026rsquo;re using on the site header includes wheels—a symbol with deep roots in heraldry. “Catherine wheels” (spoked wheels associated with St. Catherine of Alexandria) appear frequently as charges in coats of arms, and in some cases they also function as a kind of visual wordplay (“canting arms”) for names like Wheeler.\nGenealogy note: coats of arms are traditionally granted to individuals and inherited through specific lines; they aren’t universally “owned” by a surname.

My Wheeler line traces to Bedfordshire, and it’s believed this coat of arms is associated with that line. I’m using it as a visual identity mark for the project while continuing to document the proof trail.\nThe crest image # A note on heraldry # Traditionally, coats of arms are granted to individuals and inherited under specific rules, not assigned broadly to surnames. So this is best treated as a working hypothesis until the documentation is fully nailed down.\nSymbolic Connection to the Wheeler Line # For a family like the Wheelers, who were established landowners (yeomen) in Bedfordshire for centuries before many of them ventured to the American colonies, the motto reflects a sense of deep-rooted stability. Even after moving to the \u0026ldquo;New World,\u0026rdquo; keeping this motto was a way of honoring their deep English heritage.\nThe Catherine Wheels # The Catherine Wheel is one of the most distinctive and meaningful symbols in heraldry. In the case of the Wheeler family, its presence on your coat of arms is both a clever visual pun and a deeply religious tribute.\nThe Visual Pun (\u0026ldquo;Canting Arms\u0026rdquo;) In heraldry, there is a tradition called \u0026ldquo;canting arms\u0026rdquo;—which is essentially a visual pun on the family’s name. Because the surname Wheeler comes from the occupation of a wheelwright (someone who makes and repairs wheels), the use of wheels on the shield was a natural choice to identify the family at a glance.\nThe Story of Saint Catherine The specific type of wheel shown is the Catherine Wheel, named after Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a 4th-century martyr. The Miracle: According to legend, the Roman Emperor Maxentius ordered Catherine to be tortured to death on a giant, spiked \u0026ldquo;breaking wheel.\u0026rdquo; However, when she touched the wheel, it miraculously shattered into pieces, sparing her from that specific death (though she was later beheaded).\nThe Symbolism: In heraldry, the Catherine Wheel became a symbol of divine protection, resilience, and faith in the face of trial. By choosing the spiked Catherine Wheel instead of a standard wagon wheel, the family signaled that they were not just laborers, but people of faith and standing.\nConnection to Your Ancestor For your ancestor John Wheeler of Cranfield, who lived during the mid-1500s, this symbol would have been well-known. Cranfield and the surrounding Bedfordshire area were deeply religious, and Saint Catherine was a popular patron saint for scholars and those in trades. While John Wheeler was a yeoman (a high-status farmer), the adoption of these arms by his descendants—including the branch that settled in America—connected the family to a \u0026ldquo;gentle\u0026rdquo; status. It transformed an occupational name (Wheel-maker) into a noble identity (Protectors of the Faith).\nWhat I’m looking to confirm # Which Wheeler individual the arms were granted to (or first recorded with) The exact blazon (formal description) and source reference The inheritance path that connects the arms to this Wheeler line If you can help # If you have references for Wheeler arms in Bedfordshire (visitations, grants, burke/fairbairn entries, parish records, etc.), please reach out via the Contact page.\n","date":"1 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2026/01/01/the-wheeler-crest-bedfordshire-what-we-know-and-what-were-still-confirming/","section":"Posts","summary":"A quick note on the Wheeler crest associated with Bedfordshire, why we’re using it on the site, and the evidence questions still open.","title":"The Wheeler Crest (Bedfordshire): What We Know and What We’re Still Confirming","type":"posts"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve recited the story dozen of times. I first got involved in genealogy in about 1999 when I discovered my Aunt Hazel\u0026rsquo;s notes. My aunt, Hazel Wheeler, never married and tried for years to get access to the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution). When I found her notes, and not being familiar with the DAR or much about genealogy at the time, I attempted to submit an application on her behalf posthumously. While the DAR didn\u0026rsquo;t have a means to accept her application, it was the launch for me in genealogy. In 2005 I was accepted into SAR (Sons of the American Revolution) with the assistance of a cousin, Dr. Lauren Brown and then Fort Dearborn Chapter President, Bing Seibold III.\nSadly, Bing Seibold passed away in December of 2014. Ever since that time, the Fort Dearborn chapter of the SAR has been working to fill the void. I volunteered to assist in February 2016 as genealogist and registrar. To help me become familiar with some of the processes, I used the opportunity to submit an application for a memorial membership for my father, William Stamford Wheeler. I am so excited to learn that the application was approved and happy to report that my father is now a member of the SAR. The certificate will be presented to me at the upcoming meeting in January 2017.\nI am also honored and humbled to accept the invitation from the Fort Dearborn Chapter to serve as Vice President. The picture above was taken of myself, President M.

I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to keep a schedule in the future.\nDuring week 3 of the 52 Ancestors challenge I posted information about Andrew Kinney (b. Abt 1823, d. 22 May 1900). Andrew\u0026rsquo;s wife is Margaret (nee McTavish) Kinney.\nMargaret McTavish was born about 1825 in Scotland. Different records have Margaret born in different locations being either Ireland or Scotland. Most of the records that I have found indicate Scotland as the more likely location so until I have confirmation that it is Scotland or proof to the contrary, I am using Scotland as her place of birth.\nIt is particularly easier to track the movements of men in the 19th century. That is in fact the case with Margaret. Not only have I thus far been able to locate her true place of birth but I have yet to be able to locate the time and location that she entered the United States. We have reason to believe that Andrew Kinney entered the United States about 1848. According to the records that I have collected thus far, Andrew and Margaret didn\u0026rsquo;t marry until 1855 which leads me to believe that Andrew and Margaret were married in Fond du Lac. St. Joseph Catholic church in Fond du Lac is the church where many of the Kinneys were baptized so it is something to research.\nMargaret and Andrew were living in Fond du Lac from 1855 to 1874 based upon the purchase and sale of land during that time.

Not long after getting started, and with family pictures, I became interested in the life and history of my great-grandfather Sylvester Beasecker (b. 06 Feb 1859; d. 01 May 1933).\nSylvester is the son of Samuel Beasecker (b. 13 Feb 1831 in Montgomery, Ohio; d. 06 Jun 1888 in Goshen, Elkhart, Indiana). According to the International Marriage Records, 1560 - 1900, Samuel married Martha Browen born in Pennsylvania in 1836. Numerous searches for Martha Browen in and out of Pennsylvania yielded very little in regards to the background of Martha. Eventually I came across the death record for Martha (as well as several other Beaseckers) in South Bend, Indiana and she was buried in Sugar Grove Cemetery in Goshen, Indiana. On a trip from Illinois to Michigan, I made a detour and stopped by Sugar Grove Cemetery.\nUnfortunately the headstone provided little in the way of Martha\u0026rsquo;s maiden name or her parents. There is a Mary \u0026amp; John Browand buried in Sugar Grove Cemetery but I was unable to find a link from Martha to anyone with the Browand surname. Over the years I have tried different spellings to include Browan, Browand, Brown and Brower. After weeks (okay\u0026hellip;months) of research, I wrote it off as a \u0026ldquo;brick wall\u0026rdquo;.\nLike so many others in genealogy, family research is one that we pick up and put down with the changing of the seasons. As Illinois got pelted with snow and freezing temperatures, I once again picked up my genealogy. As Ancestry, NEHGS and others are continually adding new records, I did a search for Martha.\nMartha and Samuel had five children (William J, Sylvester B, Alice E, Amanda N and Rosalie M). While searching in Ancestry I came across a photo of Martha \u0026ldquo;Bowman\u0026rdquo;, Alice Beasecker, Florence Wiese and Robert A Wiese. Jackpot!\nAlice Beasecker married Allen Bemenderfer 26 Sep 1883. Their daughter Florence Bemenderfer (b. 08 Mar 1885, d. 06 Mar 1962) married Christian M. Wiese (b. 17 Aug 1884, d. 25 Nov 1967). Armed with the correct surname, I was able to locate Martha\u0026rsquo;s parents, John F. Bowman (b. 1816, d. 1856) and Nancy Stover (b. 1819, d. unknown).\nSamuel \u0026amp; Martha Beasecker\n","date":"5 January 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2014/01/05/martha-beasecker-52-ancestors-%231-martha-ann-bowman-beasecker/","section":"Posts","summary":"I began genealogy shortly after the passing of my Aunt Hazel who, to the best of my knowledge, was one of the only people in the Wheeler line doing any kind of genealogy.
