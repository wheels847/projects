      <description>I’ve recited the story dozen of times. I first got involved in genealogy in about 1999 when I discovered my Aunt Hazel’s notes. My aunt, Hazel Wheeler, never married and tried for years to get access to the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution). When I found her notes, and not being familiar with the DAR or much about genealogy at the time, I attempted to submit an application on her behalf posthumously. While the DAR didn’t have a means to accept her application, it was the launch for me in genealogy. In 2005 I was accepted into SAR (Sons of the American Revolution) with the assistance of a cousin, Dr. Lauren Brown and then Fort Dearborn Chapter President, Bing Seibold III.

      <description>Yes, it has been too long. Time seems to be get away from us. Genealogy filing stacks up which is what led to this post. I’ve had some family photos that needed scanning such as the the photo below.
The back of the photograph has the caption “Mother - Harry - Odette - Honore”.
Mother is Elizabeth Speers (nee Green) Mackenzie. “Lizzie” (b. 7 Feb 1867; d. 29 Jan 1958) was born in Dundee, Angus, Scotland and passed away in Kenora, Ontario, Canada.

      <description>While doing research for our local genealogical society (http://www.mcigs.org), I came across a post from Jen Baldwin of FindMyPast which led me to the web site of The Next Generation Genealogy Network (NGGN). In a nutshell, NGGN is committed to bridging the divide between different generations of genealogists. Having attended several genealogy conferences, I can attest that younger generations (millennials) are not as well represented as GenX and Baby Boomers.
In addition, NGGN is helping societies understand that the way that we have historically managed our genealogical societies will not attract the younger generations. For example, with less disposable income they don’t understand why they should pay to be a member. The younger generation also expects the use and availability to use social media. For example, this may mean that societies use YouTube and streaming content for monthly meetings.

      <description>Many of you that are heavily active in genealogy undoubtedly have seen the movement started by Thomas MacEntee, Genealogy Do-Over. While I would love to undertake such an effort, I simply lack the time. That being said, my genealogy research started over 15 years ago and it would be to my benefit to take a look at some of the documents and research that got me started in genealogy.

      <description>My great grandfather on my fathers side (William S. Wheeler, Honore M. Mackenzie, William A. Mackenzie) immigrated to Canada from Scotland. William Alexander Mackenzie was born 15 Oct 1858 in Cupar, Fife, Scotland. William Mackenzie is the son of William Mackenzie (b. 11 Sep 1828, d. 11 Apr 1893) and Elizabeth Boyd (b. Abt 1833, 29 Sep 1915). William, his seven siblings and his parents were found in the 1861 census in Cupar, Fife, Scotland where his father was listed as a gas engineer. In 1871 William and his family, while still in the county of Fife, had moved from Cupar to Dunfermline Burgh at 17 Rolland Street. In 1881, William is found with his family at the same address where his occupation was listed as a ’linen salesman’. William emigrated to Canada in 1885.

      <description>Recently I have a renewed appreciation for quality of data as it pertains to genealogy and family history. Over the winter I spent the cold summer months cleaning up my the place names in the my FTM database. I would like to do the same with my sources but I am having trouble finding documentation and education on doing so properly. I have found a number of blogs and brief articles on the topic, but nothing comprehensive. If anyone is aware of any sites, books or resources on the topic, please leave them in the comments.

      <description>One of my first brick walls was that of my 2nd great-grandfather, Willard Wheeler.
Willard Wheeler was born 18 August 1820 in Westmoreland, Cheshire, New Hampshire. Willard had a twin brother, William. Willard and William were the sons of Barnard Wheeler (b. 06 Dec 1788; d. abt. Jul 1836) and Susanna Pierce (b. 25 Mar 1787; d. unknown). Willard lived with his parents on 12 siblings in Swanzey, New Hampshire.

      <description>Elizabeth “Billie” Helen Beasecker was born 27 December 1907 in Melrose Park, Cook County, Illinois. Elizabeth Beasecker is the daughter of Katherine Kinney (b. 11 Oct 1869; d. 23 Dec 1912) and Sylvester B. Beasecker (b. 06 Feb 1859; d. 01 May 1933). Elizabeth was the fourth of four children born of Katherine and Sylvester.
[Elizabeth Beasecker with sister Mae (right)]
Elizabeth was only five years old when her mother passed away (during a gall bladder operation). Since her father planned on relocating to find work, Elizabeth moved in with her Aunt Nellie (nee Kinney) Mader along with her sister Mae. This is where Elizabeth established a very close relationship with Clara Mader (b. 09 Nov 1903; d. 06 Dec 1974).

      <description>I’m not sure where I saw it but I came across a question something along the lines of “if you could have 5 minutes with any ancestor who would it be, any why?” I saw this question over a week ago and it has been sitting in the back of my mind ever since. I honestly couldn’t decide. Many ancestors I wanted to talk to in order to ask questions about their ancestors (yes, these are my brick walls). In another case one person that I wanted to spend 5 minutes with was my maternal grandfather because he passed away before I was born.

      <description>Several years ago, in 2005, when I was first getting into genealogy I was excite to learn that DNA was being used to help family historians determine their background and get in contact with people that shared common Ancestors. I immediately found FamilyTreeDNA and requested a 37-marker test. I received the results and joined the “Wheeler” project.
In 2005, using DNA for genealogy was extremely new and unless you had some experience with the technology or you had someone to interpret the results for you, the value of DNA may have been limited. I was able to make contact with several individuals that I matched in the Wheeler Surname Project but it didn’t live up to my expectations. In 2008, I upgraded from 37 to 63 markers. I experienced similar results to that of my original results in that I had received results but how to use them and get in touch with others was limited. I reached out to a number of people that I had reported matches but many of them maintained paper records or family trees in GEDCOM format offline. In most cases I was unable to determine the shared ancestor.

      <description>I’ve got a little catching up to do on entries so you will see a lot of activity this week. I’ll do my best to keep a schedule in the future.
During week 3 of the 52 Ancestors challenge I posted information about Andrew Kinney (b. Abt 1823, d. 22 May 1900). Andrew’s wife is Margaret (nee McTavish) Kinney.
Margaret McTavish was born about 1825 in Scotland. Different records have Margaret born in different locations being either Ireland or Scotland. Most of the records that I have found indicate Scotland as the more likely location so until I have confirmation that it is Scotland or proof to the contrary, I am using Scotland as her place of birth.

      <description>A recent post shared some experiences which I’ve had with Ancestry.com DNA and the fact that I’ve recently reconnected with people (some now confirmed cousins) whom we suspected we shared a common ancestor. It was suspected that my 2nd great grandfather Andrew Kinney along with several other gentlemen found in Fond du Lac in the 1860 census were brothers. A recent DNA match notification has provided confirmation that one of those gentlemen, Patrick Kinney, is a brother or relative of Andrew Kinney. While Patrick isn’t one of my ancestors, I wanted to share what information I did have about Patrick to help our research.

      <description>As I have stated previously, I am fortunate enough to be surrounded by photos of my ancestors. One such ancestor that I was introduced to at a relatively young age due to photos in our home was my great grandmother, Carra Inez (nee Tuttle) Wheeler.
Carra Inez Tuttle was born 27 Jul 1856 in Cavendish, Vermont to Augustus Tuttle and Elsie Robinson. While Carra was born in Cavendish, Vermont we find that Carra and her family were in Holyoke, Massachusetts by 1863 where Carra’s father owned a store.

      <description>A recent assignment for our genealogy class is following migration patterns. While doing some research of those that came “across the pond”, I found myself researching my 2nd great grandfather on my father’s side.
Thomas Green was born 15 Nov 1842 in Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland. On 27 Feb 1865 he married Elizabeth Stewart in Dundee, Angus, Scotland. On 07 Feb 1867 in Dundee they gave birth to their first and only child, Elizabeth Speers Green.

      <description>I am currently in a genealogy certificate class at Boston University. One of our first projects was to select a family and review the 1920 and 1930 census for that family. I have reviewed lots of census records over the years but I don’t know that I have looked at them in quite this way before.
Michael McGinty was born 22 Oct 1871 in Bellageheer, Mohill, Leitrim, Ireland. Michael was the son of Michael Ginty (b. abt. 1831 in Leitrim, Ireland) and Elizabeth McGarry.

      <description>I am extremely fortunate that my family has been able to preserve some fantastic family photos. One such photo is that of Andrew Kinney (or photos). You may recall that we introduced Sylvester Beasecker (52 Ancestors, #2) who married Katharine Kinney (b. 11 Oct 1869, d. 23 Dec 1912) about 1896 in Pennsylvania. Katharine Kinney’s parents were Andrew Kinney and Margaret McTavish.
Andrew Kinney was born about 1823 in Ireland. We have only been able to identify the approximate birth date and location for Andrew Kinney based upon census records, voter registration and death records. Andrew passed away 22 May 1900 in Chicago, Cook, Illinois. We know from an article in The Commonwealth published in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin that Andrew’s birth year is about 1823 based upon the age cited in the article. The article states that Andrew’s remains arrived from Chicago after Andrew passed away in his home located at 424 Park Avenue in Chicago.

While we are talking about the Beaseckers, lets talk about one of the more interesting men in my family tree based upon what I have found out about him. Sylvester B. Beasecker was born 06 Feb 1859 in Goshen, Elkhart, Indiana. Sylvester is the son of Samuel Beasecker and Martha Ann Bowman. Over the course of his life, Sylvester had four (4) wives, owned several businesses and lived in several different states to include Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Georgia.

      <description>As the website has been taken down (Ancestry.com makes it so easy to publish the tree and it didn’t make sense maintaining both), I figured that I would re-purpose the domain name to use on the blog. One of the project ideas that came up for genealogy was “52 Ancestors in 52 weeks” (http://www.nostorytoosmall.com/posts/challenge-52-ancestors-in-52-weeks/). I love this idea. Look for the first blog entry later this week.

      <description>I began genealogy shortly after the passing of my Aunt Hazel who, to the best of my knowledge, was one of the only people in the Wheeler line doing any kind of genealogy. Not long after getting started, and with family pictures, I became interested in the life and history of my great-grandfather Sylvester Beasecker (b. 06 Feb 1859; d. 01 May 1933).
Sylvester is the son of Samuel Beasecker (b. 13 Feb 1831 in Montgomery, Ohio; d. 06 Jun 1888 in Goshen, Elkhart, Indiana). According to the International Marriage Records, 1560 - 1900, Samuel married Martha Browen born in Pennsylvania in 1836. Numerous searches for Martha Browen in and out of Pennsylvania yielded very little in regards to the background of Martha. Eventually I came across the death record for Martha (as well as several other Beaseckers) in South Bend, Indiana and she was buried in Sugar Grove Cemetery in Goshen, Indiana. On a trip from Illinois to Michigan, I made a detour and stopped by Sugar Grove Cemetery.

      <description>Wheeler Genealogy is my personal research hub for documenting the Wheeler family story through records, photos, and narrative write-ups. It’s part archive, part notebook, and part “public-facing summary” of what I’ve proven, what I’m still testing, and what I’ve learned along the way.
What you’ll find here # Stories: narrative write-ups that bring people and places to life Posts: research notes, document deep-dives, and working theories (with sources) Images & artifacts: photos, scans, and “why this record matters” context Surnames & families # This site is centered on the Wheeler family, with frequent research into connected lines and collateral relatives. Some recurring surnames you’ll see include:
