Wheeler Genealogy is my personal research hub for documenting the Wheeler family story through **records, photos, and narrative write-ups**. It’s part archive, part notebook, and part “public-facing summary” of what I’ve proven, what I’m still testing, and what I’ve learned along the way.

## What you’ll find here
- **Stories**: narrative write-ups that bring people and places to life
- **Posts**: research notes, document deep-dives, and working theories (with sources)
- **Images & artifacts**: photos, scans, and “why this record matters” context

## Surnames & families
This site is centered on the **Wheeler** family, with frequent research into connected lines and collateral relatives. Some recurring surnames you’ll see include:

- Wheeler  
- Tuttle  
- Beasecker / Basecker (and spelling variations)  
- Bowman  
- Brown / Brower (and spelling variations)

As the archive grows, this list will expand as new connections are confirmed.

## Places & regions
Most of the research clusters around a few geographic hubs:

- **Illinois** (especially northern Illinois / Chicagoland)
- **Indiana** (including Elkhart / Goshen area and other northern Indiana communities)
- **Ohio**
- **Pennsylvania**
- **Massachusetts** (including Holyoke area and surrounding towns)
- **Vermont**
- **Connecticut**

## How I approach research
Genealogy is at its best when it’s **evidence-driven**. When possible, I aim to:
- cite records and link to sources
- distinguish facts from hypotheses
- note conflicts and open questions
- update conclusions when better evidence appears

If you spot something that doesn’t look right—or you have a document/photo that adds clarity—I genuinely want to hear from you.
