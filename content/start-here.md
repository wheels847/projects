## How research is presented here
Genealogy is at its best when it’s evidence-driven. When possible, I try to:
- cite sources (and link to records where available)
- separate proven facts from working hypotheses
- note conflicts and open questions
- update conclusions when better evidence appears

If you spot an error—or you have a document or photo that adds clarity—I genuinely want to hear from you.
