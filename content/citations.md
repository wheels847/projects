This site is a living archive of Wheeler family research—stories, research notes, transcriptions, and images. If you use something from here, please cite it and help keep the record trail clear.

## How to cite this site
### Cite a page or post (recommended)
Use this format (Chicago-style, genealogy-friendly):

**Bill Wheeler, “{Title of Page or Post},” *Wheeler Genealogy*, last updated {date if known}, accessed {today’s date}, {URL}.**

Example:

Bill Wheeler, “From Cranfield, Bedfordshire to New England: A Wheeler Family Story,” *Wheeler Genealogy*, accessed 2 January 2026, https://www.wheelergenealogy.com/....

### Cite an image hosted on this site
If you reuse an image, cite the page where it appears plus a description:

**Bill Wheeler, “{Post Title},” image of {description}, *Wheeler Genealogy*, accessed {date}, {URL}.**

## Sources and evidence
Where possible, posts include citations or links to records (Ancestry, FamilySearch, newspapers, vital records, probate, deeds, etc.). If a conclusion is uncertain, I try to label it as a working hypothesis.

If you believe something here is incorrect, I’d much rather fix it than defend it—send the best evidence you have.
