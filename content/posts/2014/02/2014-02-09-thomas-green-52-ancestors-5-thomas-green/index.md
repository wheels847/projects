A recent assignment for our genealogy class is following migration patterns.  While doing some research of those that came "across the pond", I found myself researching my 2nd great grandfather on my father's side.

Thomas Green was born 15 Nov 1842 in Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.  On 27 Feb 1865 he married Elizabeth Stewart in Dundee, Angus, Scotland.  On 07 Feb 1867 in Dundee they gave birth to their first and only child, Elizabeth Speers Green.

At the time of the 1871 Scotland census where Thomas and his family were living in Liff, Angus, Scotland which is just northwest of Dundee.  Shortly thereafter, in 1872, Thomas and his family emigrated to Canada.  In the 1901 Canadian Census Thomas and his family are found in what was then known as Rat Portage now known as Kenora.

Thomas remained in Kenora for the remainder of his years until his death 06 Feb 1910 where he was proclaimed dead at St. Joseph's Hospital by his son-in-law, William McKenzie.  On his certificate of death it cites Harry Green as his father but does not list the maiden name of his mother.
