![tuttlecara_photo](images/tuttlecara_photo.jpg)As I have stated previously, I am fortunate enough to be surrounded by photos of my ancestors. One such ancestor that I was introduced to at a relatively young age due to photos in our home was my great grandmother, Carra Inez (nee Tuttle) Wheeler.

Carra Inez Tuttle was born 27 Jul 1856 in Cavendish, Vermont to Augustus Tuttle and Elsie Robinson. While Carra was born in Cavendish, Vermont we find that Carra and her family were in Holyoke, Massachusetts by 1863 where Carra's father owned a store.

 

![tuttlecarai_photo](images/tuttlecarai_photo.jpg)On 20 Jun 1878, Carra married John Edward Wheeler (b. 22 Nov 1849) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Carra and John had five children (Harry, Stanley, Waldo, Hazel and Howard). While Carra and her family moved around in Connecticut from Holyoke to Naugatuck and then to Derby, Carra and John eventually returned to Holyoke.

Carra passed away on 25 Jan 1924 during a tragic accident when she was struck by a vehicle while she was crossing the street. Carra is buried with her husband in Foredale Cemetery in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
