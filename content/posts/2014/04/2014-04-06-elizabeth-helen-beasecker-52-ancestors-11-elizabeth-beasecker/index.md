Elizabeth "Billie" Helen Beasecker was born 27 December 1907 in Melrose Park, Cook County, Illinois. Elizabeth Beasecker is the daughter of Katherine Kinney (b. 11 Oct 1869; d. 23 Dec 1912) and Sylvester B. Beasecker (b. 06 Feb 1859; d. 01 May 1933). Elizabeth was the fourth of four children born of Katherine and Sylvester.

Since her father planned on relocating to find work, Elizabeth moved in with her Aunt Nellie (nee Kinney) Mader along with her sister Mae. This is where Elizabeth established a very close relationship with Clara Mader (b. 09 Nov 1903; d. 06 Dec 1974).

Elizabeth's father (Sylvester) eventually found work in Duluth, Minnesota and he also found his fourth wife Mary S. Graham.  Elizabeth and her sister Mae live with their father and their step mother for a short time before returning to Chicago to live with their aunt Nellie.

Church in Chicago.  In attendance and standing up at their wedding were John McGinty's brother Thomas as well as Clara Mader.  Not only was Clara the maid of honor, Clara would later be the godmother to Elizabeth's third child, Mary Margaret McGinty.

Shortly after her husband's passing in 1962, Elizabeth relocated to Florida to be with her sister Mae in more pleasant weather.

 

Elizabeth passed away 31 December 1992 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Elizabeth was relocated to All Saints cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois to be laid to rest next to her husband.
