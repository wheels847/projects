One of my first brick walls was that of my 2nd great-grandfather, Willard Wheeler.

Willard Wheeler was born 18 August 1820 in Westmoreland, Cheshire, New Hampshire.  Willard had a twin brother, William.  Willard and William were the sons of Barnard Wheeler (b. 06 Dec 1788; d. abt. Jul 1836) and Susanna Pierce (b. 25 Mar 1787; d. unknown).  Willard lived with his parents on 12 siblings in Swanzey, New Hampshire.

About January 1849, Willard married Emily Maria Stanford (b. 11 Aug 1829; d. aft 11 Jan 1883).  Shortly after their marriage, Emily and Willard relocated to nearby Winchester, New Hampshire.  Emily and Willard had six children, all of them born in Winchester, New Hampshire.

Willard was a farmer and passed away shortly after the birth of their sixth child due to an accident from an explosion.  Willard is buried at South Winchester cemetery in an unmarked grave.
