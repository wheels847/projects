I am extremely fortunate that my family has been able to preserve some fantastic family photos.  One such photo is that of Andrew Kinney (or photos).  You may recall that we introduced Sylvester Beasecker (52 Ancestors, #2) who married Katharine Kinney (b. 11 Oct 1869, d. 23 Dec 1912) about 1896 in Pennsylvania.  Katharine Kinney's parents were Andrew Kinney and Margaret McTavish.

![andrewkinney_photo](images/andrewkinney_photo.jpg)Andrew Kinney was born about 1823 in Ireland.  We have only been able to identify the approximate birth date and location for Andrew Kinney based upon census records, voter registration and death records.  Andrew passed away 22 May 1900 in Chicago, Cook, Illinois.  We know from an article in _The Commonwealth_ published in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin that Andrew's birth year is about 1823 based upon the age cited in the article.  The article states that Andrew's remains arrived from Chicago after Andrew passed away in his home located at 424 Park Avenue in Chicago.

While we know that both Andrew and his wife Margaret (nee McTavish) Kinney were transported back to Fond du Lac at the time of their deaths and we know further that Andrew's funeral was at St. Joseph's church in Fond du Lac, I have been unable to locate either of their burial locations/headstones.

![AndrewKinneySr2](images/andrewkinneysr2.jpg)There is so much we still don't know about Andrew and his wife, Margaret.  We know that Andrew and Margaret resided in Fond du Lac from 1852 to 1874.  We know that both Andrew and Margaret were in Chicago in 1890 which is when Margaret passed away.

We know that Andrew and Margaret owned land in Fond du Lac but what prompted them to be buried in Fond du Lac when they passed away in Chicago.  We've been able to connect with several other Kinneys in the area but have been unable to establish a connection.  We have still been unable to identify the parents of either Andrew or Margaret.  While we know that both Andrew and Margaret were both from Illinois, we don't know if they were married in Ireland or in the United States.  Did Andrew, Margaret or both have family in Fond du Lac which prompted them to be interred in that location?  I'm confident that the answer to some of these questions are in Fond du Lac.  I see a trip in my future.
