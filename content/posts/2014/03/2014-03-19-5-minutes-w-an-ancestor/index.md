title: "5 Minutes w/ an ancestor"

I'm not sure where I saw it but I came across a question something along the lines of "if you could have 5 minutes with any ancestor who would it be, any why?" I saw this question over a week ago and it has been sitting in the back of my mind ever since. I honestly couldn't decide. Many ancestors I wanted to talk to in order to ask questions about their ancestors (yes, these are my brick walls). In another case one person that I wanted to spend 5 minutes with was my maternal grandfather because he passed away before I was born.
