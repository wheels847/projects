My maternal grandfather is John Patrick McGinty (b. 24 May 1905, Chicago, IL; d. 01 Nov 1962, Chicago, IL) who was the eldest son of Michael McGinty and Nellie Carolan.

John attended and graduated from St. Charles Borromeo for middle school in 1913. John graduated high school from St. Patrick Academy in June 1921. Upon graduation from high school, John followed in his father's footsteps working as a plumber. ![John Patrick McGinty](images/jpmcgintyncar.jpg)

John eventually strayed from this line of work and got a job as a clerk at AT&T in 1925. Aside from working as a plumber, this is the only place that John will work his entire life. John worked at AT&T for 37 years as an accountant before retiring.

John met and was married to Helen Elizabeth Beasecker on 27 June 1932. Thomas McGinty, John's brother, and Clara Mader, Elizabeth's cousin, stood up for their wedding. John and Elizabeth lived at 243 Stanley Avenue in Park Ridge where they had three children.

John passed away at the young age of 58 years of age due to a pulmonary embolism.  John is buried with his wife at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois.
