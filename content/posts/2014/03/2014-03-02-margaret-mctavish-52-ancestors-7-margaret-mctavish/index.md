I've got a little catching up to do on entries so you will see a lot of activity this week. I'll do my best to keep a schedule in the future.

During week 3 of the 52 Ancestors challenge I posted information about Andrew Kinney (b. Abt 1823, d. 22 May 1900). Andrew's wife is Margaret (nee McTavish) Kinney.

Margaret McTavish was born about 1825 in Scotland. Different records have Margaret born in different locations being either Ireland or Scotland. Most of the records that I have found indicate Scotland as the more likely location so until I have confirmation that it is Scotland or proof to the contrary, I am using Scotland as her place of birth.

It is particularly easier to track the movements of men in the 19th century. That is in fact the case with Margaret. Not only have I thus far been able to locate her true place of birth but I have yet to be able to locate the time and location that she entered the United States. We have reason to believe that Andrew Kinney entered the United States about 1848. According to the records that I have collected thus far, Andrew and Margaret didn't marry until 1855 which leads me to believe that Andrew and Margaret were married in Fond du Lac. St. Joseph Catholic church in Fond du Lac is the church where many of the Kinneys were baptized so it is something to research.

Margaret and Andrew were living in Fond du Lac from 1855 to 1874 based upon the purchase and sale of land during that time. During that time, Andrew and Margaret had eight (8) children all born in Fond du Lac:

- Andrew Kinney (b. Abt Nov 1856); baptized 16 Nov 1856
- Hannah Kinney (b. 23 Jan 1857)
- Elizabeth Kinney (b. Abt 1859)
- Mary E. Kinney (b. Abt 1861)
- James Kinney (b. 16 Dec 1863)
- Frank E. Kinney (b. Abt Mar 1867)
- Katharine "Kittie" Kinney (b. 11 Oct 1869)
- Nellie Gertrude Kinney (b. 14 Feb 1873)

In 1874, we see Margaret, Andrew and the family leave Fond du Lac.  While it is probable that they were in or around Chicago, we don't see them in census records until 1890.  It was about this time, on 17 Jan 1890, that Margaret (nee McTavish) Kinney passed away.  Cause of death was meningitis.  Margaret passed away at 11 Maplewood Avenue, Chicago, IL.  This was not her residence (most likely the residence of one of her children) as Margaret and Andrew were living at 412 Park Avenue, Chicago, IL at the time of her death.  The death certificate issued by Cook County indicates that Margaret was only a residence of the state for one year prior to her passing.

Where was Margaret and her family from 1874 to 1889?  It is one of the many questions that is yet to be answered when it comes to Margaret's past.
