## Claim (working summary)
Evidence indicates that **Augustus Tuttle** and his brother **Oscar S. Tuttle** operated a business under the name **A. & O. S. Tuttle**, beginning as a **general store in Cavendish village, Vermont (1857)** and later moving to **Holyoke, Massachusetts (fall 1863)** where the business focused on **dry goods**.

## Evidence we have
### 1850 census (baseline occupation)
- Augustus Tuttle listed as **farmer** in Weathersfield, Windsor County, Vermont (1850).

### Secondary narrative source (strong lead)
A biographical sketch of Oscar S. Tuttle states:
- In **1857**, “A. & O. S. Tuttle” opened a **general store** in **Cavendish village**, Vermont.
- In the **fall of 1863**, the firm moved to **Holyoke, Massachusetts** and focused on **dry goods**.

### Holyoke merchandise signal (later business context)
A later Holyoke-era business description for **O. S. Tuttle** lists apparel and “small wares” and gives a High Street address. This likely reflects the later Holyoke continuation of the venture, and it helps define what “dry goods” meant in practice.

## What we still need to prove (primary sources)
To confidently answer: *What was the store? Where was it? What was sold?*

### Cavendish (1857+)
- **Newspaper ads** (Windsor County papers)
- **Town tax lists** (merchant vs farmer)
- **Deeds/land records** (store lot or commercial property)
- **Local maps / atlases** showing commercial buildings

### Holyoke (1863+)
- **City directories (Holyoke)** for A. Tuttle / O. S. Tuttle / A. & O. S. Tuttle
- **Newspaper ads** for dry goods and store location
- **Sanborn maps** for storefront footprint once an address is confirmed

## Next actions (practical research plan)
1. Pull Holyoke city directory entries for the years surrounding **1863–1870** and extract:
   - business description
   - address
   - partnership name changes
2. Search Holyoke/Springfield papers for “Tuttle” + “dry goods” + “High Street.”
3. Search Cavendish-area papers for “A. & O. S. Tuttle” and “general store.”
4. Confirm identity:
   - Ensure the A. Tuttle in the business sources matches **Augustus Tuttle Jr.** (same person in the family line), not a different “A. Tuttle.”
