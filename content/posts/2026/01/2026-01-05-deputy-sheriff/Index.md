This week’s Wheeler update is equal parts progress and reality-check.

## What I finished

I have **completed my SAR supplemental application** using my documented **lineage from Solomon Wheeler**. The remaining work is the harder, more interesting part: **locking down proof that the “Deputy Sheriff Solomon Wheeler” in Revolutionary-era New Hampshire records is the same man as my 4th great grandfather**.

That identity link is the hinge. Without it, “Deputy Sheriff Solomon Wheeler” is a strong lead—but still just a lead.

## Why the deputy sheriff angle matters

The SAR recognizes **patriotic service** that can be military, **civil**, or other overt support of Revolutionary governments during the accepted service period. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

So if the Deputy Sheriff in these documents is my Solomon, it potentially provides a qualifying service path that fits the historical reality: plenty of Patriots served their communities through courts, enforcement, oaths, and local government machinery rather than marching in militia ranks.

## The two documents that put “Solomon Wheeler” on the record

### 1) Exeter, New Hampshire — April 1777 (Rockingham County)

The Morgan Library & Museum catalog describes a document addressed to the Rockingham County sheriff (or deputy), and notes an **autograph note on the verso** by **Deputy Sheriff Solomon Wheeler**, dated **23 April 1777**, describing a search and forwarding a prisoner in a counterfeiting-related case. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 2) Raymond, New Hampshire — April 1783 (Rockingham County)

The Gilder Lehrman Institute catalog describes an **investigation/dismissal** document dated **7 April 1783** (with Josiah Bartlett involved as justice of the peace) and notes it was also signed by **Deputy Sheriff of Rockingham County Solomon Wheeler**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Action taken:** I have **ordered the 1783 investigation** from the **Gilder Lehrman Reference Department** so I can work from the actual document image/text, not just the catalog description.

## The problem I’m still solving

Rockingham County is in southeastern New Hampshire. My Solomon is tied (later, at least) to **Westmoreland, Cheshire County**, in the southwest. Names repeat, people move, and “rare” is not the same as “unique.”

So here’s the working hypothesis:

> The Deputy Sheriff named in 1777 and 1783 is my Solomon Wheeler, and there’s a paper trail connecting him from Massachusetts/New Hampshire origins to later life in Westmoreland.

It’s plausible—but genealogy doesn’t run on plausibility. It runs on receipts.

## What I’m doing next

1. **Get and analyze the 1783 Gilder Lehrman document** for identifiers: residence, signature comparison, associates, context clues. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
2. **Pull the Morgan document image/details** and look for the same: signature, jurisdiction language, people involved. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
3. **Build the bridge records**: Rockingham court/sheriff material, deeds, tax lists, and any appointment/commission entries that tie a Solomon Wheeler to a place and time that fits my Solomon’s timeline.  
4. **Correlate, don’t assume**: I’m looking for at least one “slam-dunk” connector (wife’s name, consistent residence, distinctive signature, or a chain of records that removes ambiguity).
