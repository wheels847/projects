This page is a curated entry point into the archive by **place**. Posts often connect multiple states over time (migration, marriage, military service, work, etc.), so browsing by place is a good way to find clusters.

## Primary research hubs
- **Illinois** → [/tags/illinois/](/tags/illinois/)
- **Indiana** → [/tags/indiana/](/tags/indiana/)
- **Ohio** → [/tags/ohio/](/tags/ohio/)

## Tips for place-based searching
- Try both the **town** and the **county** (records are often filed at the county level).
- Search with older place names/abbreviations (especially in 1800s documents).
- Combine place + surname for precision.
