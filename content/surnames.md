This page is a curated entry point into the archive by **surname**. Many posts include spelling variants, collateral relatives, and “same-name” puzzles—so if you don’t see a name here, try **Search**.

## Core families
- **Wheeler** → [/tags/wheeler/](/tags/wheeler/)
- **Tuttle** → [/tags/tuttle/](/tags/tuttle/)
- **Beasecker / Basecker** → [/tags/beasecker/](/tags/beasecker/)
- **Bowman** → [/tags/bowman/](/tags/bowman/)
- **Brown / Brower** → [/tags/brown/](/tags/brown/)

## Common research notes
### Spelling variants
Older records and indexes often vary spelling (and sometimes handwriting makes it worse). When a spelling variant is likely the same family, I treat it as a single research thread and note the variant in the write-up.

### Same-name caution
If you see a familiar name, don’t assume it’s *your* person yet—same-name individuals are everywhere in New England and the Midwest. Posts will usually call out how identity is confirmed (or why it’s still uncertain).

## Not listed?
Use search to look for:
- maiden names
- alternate spellings
- places (town/county/state)
- associated relatives
