Some ancestors leave us a neat paper trail. Others leave a trail that feels like real life—messy at the edges, full of movement, and anchored by a few strong facts.

**Michael McGinty**, my great-grandfather, is one of those.

## County Leitrim beginnings
Michael was born **22 Oct 1871** in **County Leitrim, Ireland**. Family notes tied to this record also associate his birth with **Bellageeher (Roosky area)**—a useful clue for narrowing searches to a specific locality rather than “Ireland” in general.

His parents were:
- **Michael Ginty / McGinty** (a farmer; born **19 Sep 1831** in **Anskert, Gortletteragh, Leitrim, Ireland**)
- **Elizabeth McGarry** (born before **8 Feb 1848**, Leitrim, Ireland)

Their marriage is recorded as **8 Feb 1869** in **Leitrim, Ireland**—a strong anchor point for building the earlier generation.

## A surname that shifts in the records
Michael appears under both **McGinty** and **Ginty** in different record contexts. That’s not unusual for Irish surnames in American records—spacing, abbreviations, and indexers can flatten or alter names.

When searching, it’s worth trying:
- McGinty / Mc Ginty / Mcginty
- Ginty

## Immigration: the year isn’t perfectly consistent
Different records suggest different arrival years. In this data set, you’ll see evidence pointing to immigration in the **late 1880s to early 1890s** (multiple sources report different years).

That’s not a problem—it’s a research opportunity:
- Find the best primary evidence (passenger list + matching destination/relative, or a naturalization record).
- Then lock the date down.

## Chicago: marriage, work, and a growing household
By **1903**, Michael is firmly in **Chicago**.

He married **Nellie Carolan** on **10 Jun 1903** in **Chicago, Cook County, Illinois**, with a note tying the marriage to **Holy Family Church**.

Michael worked as a **plumber**—a trade that shows up consistently in the record set. Family notes and obituary material also place him in Chicago’s working neighborhoods, and later census-era residence entries keep him in the city for decades.

A specific early family residence note places the household at:
- **2010 W. 12th Street, Chicago** (dated **24 May 1904**)

## Five sons — and real loss
Michael and Nellie had five sons, all born in Chicago:

- **John Patrick McGinty** (b. **24 May 1904**; d. **1 Nov 1962**)  
- **Thomas Edward McGinty** (b. **28 Dec 1905**; d. **24 Jan 1977**)  
- **Arthur J. McGinty** (b. **24 Jan 1908**; d. **3 Apr 1983**)  
- **Francis P. McGinty** (b. **2 Apr 1910**; d. **24 Sep 1923**)  
- **Aloysius McGinty** (b. **22 Nov 1912**; d. **27 Feb 1915**)  

Two sons dying young changes the tone of a family story. It’s the kind of reality you can’t “pretty up” with genealogy—it’s just part of the human record.

## Widower years and a long Chicago life
Nellie died **13 Nov 1913** in Chicago and was buried **14 Nov 1913** in **Hillside, Cook County, Illinois**.

Michael appears afterward as a **widower** in later census-era entries, continuing his life and work in Chicago for decades.

He died **21 May 1943**, with one death entry specifically naming **St. Anne Hospital, Chicago**, and was buried **24 May 1943** in **Hillside, Cook County, Illinois**—likely placing husband and wife in the same cemetery area.

## What I’m trying to prove next
This story is strong, but it can get even better with a few primary-source wins:

- Confirm Michael’s **exact townland/parish** in Leitrim (Bellageeher/Roosky clue is promising)
- Identify the **best immigration proof** (passenger list + matching relatives/destination)
- Find Michael’s **naturalization record** (petitions often name birth location and arrival details)
- Track the family through **Chicago city directories** (plumber listings can be surprisingly rich)
- Pull church registers (Holy Family / St. Lucy’s) for sacramental records

If you have family documents, photos, or stories tied to Michael and Nellie, I’d love to incorporate them.
