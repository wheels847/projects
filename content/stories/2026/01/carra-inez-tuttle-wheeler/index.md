Some lives read like a map. **Carra Inez Tuttle**—also recorded in some places as **Clara Inez**—is one of those lives: Vermont beginnings, a marriage that connects New England lines, years in Connecticut where children are born, and then a return to Holyoke, Massachusetts.

## Vermont beginnings: the Tuttle and Robinson families

Carra Inez Tuttle was born **27 July 1857** in **Cavendish, Windsor County, Vermont**.

Her parents were:

- **Augustus Tuttle Jr.**, born **29 June 1830** in **Woodstock, Windsor County, Vermont**, died **22 November 1885** in **Taunton, Bristol County, Massachusetts**  
- **Elsie Maria Robinson**, born **21 September 1835** in **Weathersfield, Windsor County, Vermont**, died **7 September 1903** in **Holyoke, Hampden County, Massachusetts**

Family notes in the research file associate Augustus Tuttle with owning a store—exactly the kind of small detail that makes a paper trail feel human.

Augustus and Elsie married in **1863** (recorded as Vermont), and the family’s movement between Vermont and Massachusetts shows up repeatedly in later census-era records.

## A marriage that links lines: Wheeler meets Tuttle

Carra married **John Edward Wheeler** on **20 June 1878** in **Holyoke, Hampden County, Massachusetts**.

John Edward Wheeler was born **22 November 1849** in **Winchester, Cheshire County, New Hampshire**, and later appears in records tied strongly to **Holyoke, Massachusetts**.

This marriage becomes a bridge between multiple New England states—Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts—and then, for a time, Connecticut.

## Connecticut years: children and a growing household

Over the next years, Carra and John’s children were born in **New Haven County, Connecticut**, which gives us a good clue that the family lived (at least temporarily) in that area:

- **Harry Edward Wheeler**, born **30 May 1880** — **New Haven, Connecticut**
- **Stanley Cushman Wheeler**, born **28 August 1883** — **Naugatuck, Connecticut**
- **Waldo Stanford Wheeler**, born **29 October 1889** — **Naugatuck, Connecticut**
- **Hazel Madeline Wheeler**, born **22 March 1892** — **Derby, Connecticut**
- **Howard Robinson Wheeler**, born **5 June 1894** — **Derby, Connecticut**

Even without every detail filled in yet, the pattern is clear: this is a working family moving where work and opportunity take them, with the paper trail recording their changing towns through the births of their children.

## Return to Holyoke — and a quiet closing

Carra’s later life ties back to **Holyoke**, and she died there on **25 January 1924**.

John followed not long after, dying in Holyoke on **21 March 1924**.

Two deaths within the same spring feels like the closing of a long chapter—one that started in rural Vermont and ended in an industrial-era Massachusetts city.

## A note on names
In the GEDCOM research file, Carra appears under multiple recorded forms (including **Clara Inez** and **Carra Inez**). That’s not unusual in genealogical work: spelling, handwriting, indexing, and family usage can all create legitimate variants. When searching, it’s worth trying both.
