Recently I have a renewed appreciation for quality of data as it pertains to genealogy and family history. Over the winter I spent the cold summer months cleaning up my the place names in the my FTM database. I would like to do the same with my sources but I am having trouble finding documentation and education on doing so properly. I have found a number of blogs and brief articles on the topic, but nothing comprehensive. If anyone is aware of any sites, books or resources on the topic, please leave them in the comments.
